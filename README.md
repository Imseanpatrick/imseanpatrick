## Hi there! I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

You can peruse my data science project portfolio [here]([(https://imseanpatrick.github.io/)).

I'm the Assistant Director of the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science, and a PhD student in Complex Systems and Data Science at the University of Vermont, where I am a fellow of the MassMutual Center for Excellence in Complex Systems and Data Science, and the Gund Institute for Environment. As a computing grauduate student with an educational background in the social sciences, I aim to bridge the gap between folks in computing and the social sciences to co-create impactful and digestable research and analytical projects. 

As a Public interest technologist and computational social scientist specializing in Machine Learning, NLP and social media analytics, my research focuses on using AI to arm policymakers and practtioners with data useful to their campaigns and missions, including applications of AI and other technologies to improve policing, and understand the international wildlife trade and captive wildlife tourism on social media. My broad range of professional experience includes analytical and research roles in the government, nonprofit, and private sector. 

I routinely give talks and workshops to undergraduate and graduate students and individuals in industry and government to help them understand the benefits of learning and applying python in their analytical workflow. I have guest lectured in courses on Criminal Justice, Sociology, Anthropology, and Business Statistics, on topics such as qualitative and quantitative analysis, introduction to python, introduction to machine learning and text analysis with python, and introduction to statistical computing with excel and R.
