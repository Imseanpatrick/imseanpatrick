## Hi there! I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

You can peruse my data science project portfolio [here](https://imseanpatrick.github.io/).

I'm the Assistant Director of the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science and a PhD student in Complex Systems and Data Science at the University of Vermont. I am also a fellow of the MassMutual Center for Excellence in Complex Systems and Data Science and the Gund Institute for Environment.

As a computing graduate student with a foundation in social science, I aim to bridge the gap between computer science and social science, co-creating impactful and accessible research and analytical projects.

As a public interest technologist and computational social scientist, I specialize in machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and social media analytics. My research uses data science to equip policymakers and practitioners with information to drive meaningful change, including applications for improving policing and analyzing the international wildlife trade and captive wildlife tourism on social media. My professional experience spans analytical and research roles across government, nonprofit, and private sectors.

I also enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge. I give talks and workshops to students, industry professionals, and government audiences, helping them incorporate Python and ML into their analytical workflows. Iâ€™ve guest lectured in Criminal Justice, Sociology, Anthropology, and Business Statistics courses, covering topics like:

Qualitative and quantitative analysis
Introduction to Python
Machine learning and text analysis with Python
Statistical computing with Excel and R
